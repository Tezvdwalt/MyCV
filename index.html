    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      Experienced <b>Client Relationship Manager</b> with a demonstrated history
      of working in the IT and services industry. Skilled in Helpdesk Support,

      <b>Software Development</b>, and Customs Regulations. Strong problem

    </p>

    <p>
      I have spent the last 11 years doing software support and trying to learn
      SQL scripting and coding in my own capacity. I have always wanted to go
      into this field but until now never really had the opportunity as everyone
      requires experience. I started with the Hyperiondev bootcamp and this is
      my new attempt to change my path.
    </p>

    <p>
      My motivation has always been my children. Being a single mother I have
      always wanted to be a good role model, now that they're older my
      motivation has switched from them to me. I want to do things that matter
      and make me happy.
